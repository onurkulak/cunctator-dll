# cunctator-dll
dll source code for my Old World mod

The mod includes many changes in battle and war mechanics. It is aimed to give a more emotional experience by bonding you to your soldiers and more epic wars rather than alpha-strikes. 

Some main goals include:
* make a handful experienced units more important
* draw a better distinction between "expendable rookies" and your "alpha-team"
* reduce alpha-strike
* more realistic battles with retreat mechanics
* wars will take longer and will be more attrition focused
  - not certain at this point, but there could be some supply line mechanics
